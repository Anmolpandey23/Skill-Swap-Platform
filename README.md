# 🌟 Skill Swap – Learn Anything, Teach Anything

Skill Swap is a simple idea:  
If you know something, and I know something, why not teach each other instead of paying for classes?  
No money. No fancy apps. Just people helping people.

## What’s This About?
In India, there are so many talented people — students, homemakers, professionals, even retirees — who have amazing skills.  
At the same time, we all want to learn new things, but courses can be expensive.

Example:  
- You’re great at photography but want to learn cooking.  
- Someone else is an amazing cook but wants to learn photography.  
- Boom! You both swap skills. No money spent.

Skill Swap is a space where this exchange happens easily and safely.
